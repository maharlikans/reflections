When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I were working from multiple places, or I had been switching machines very often, I'd want to use a remote repository. Also if I'm worried that all my work might get lost on my local machine if I lose it or something happens to it, using a local repository is good too. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be some changes on the remote repository that you don't want in
    your local repository. If some changes on the remote break your code or
    don't merge well with your code, you'd have a problem.
