When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I were working from multiple places, or I had been switching machines very often, I'd want to use a remote repository. Also if I'm worried that all my work might get lost on my local machine if I lose it or something happens to it, using a local repository is good too. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be some changes on the remote repository that you don't want in
    your local repository. If some changes on the remote break your code or
    don't merge well with your code, you'd have a problem.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies on github of another user's repository. You would fork on
    github if you'd like to edit someone else's code but don't have write access
    to their repository.

    Clones are local copies of remote repositories. You'd use this when you have
    an existing remote repository and you'd like to edit the code on your own
    computer. 

    Branches are a separate commit string from another one. You use branches
    when you're working on a version of the code that differs from the main one
    everyone uses. If you're doing some sort of project on existing code, using
    branches is useful.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you have a copy of the last known state stored locally, you can use it
    offline if you're going on a plane ride, or something similar. Having to
    rely on the internet all the time is inconvenient and impossible right now.
